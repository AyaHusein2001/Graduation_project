# Webby: A Machine Learning-Powered Website Development Tool 🚀

## Abstract 📋
The Webby project is a groundbreaking approach to website development, designed to cater to users with limited IT expertise. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Webby translates user requirements, articulated in natural language, into functional website components in real-time. The frontend development team focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface using modern web technologies. Meanwhile, the backend team extracted essential database components from user descriptions, generating SQL queries and backend CRUD operations using Django. These combined efforts result in a comprehensive solution that simplifies website development while ensuring robust backend functionality and data integrity.

## User Guide 📖

### Steps for Database and GUI Description

1. **Database Description:**
   - In the "Database Description" textbox, describe the details of your website's database.
   - Provide this description as if explaining it to a specialist who will create the database for you.
   - Specify the names of the tables you want and list the columns for each table.

2. **GUI Description:**
   - In the "GUI Description" textbox, describe the customizations you want for your website's interface, including styling details.
   - Click the "Open Color Picker" button to choose the main color of your website.
   - After selecting the color, click the "Submit" button.

3. **Table Names Confirmation:**
   - The system will detect the table names from your database description input.
   - You can add more tables in the "New Table" text field or delete existing tables by clicking the delete icon next to the table name.

4. **Final Schema Review:**
   - The system will display a list of your final database tables along with their columns (including extra columns provided by the system).
   - You can accept this as the final schema or make further modifications by adding or deleting columns for any table.

5. **Finalizing and Downloading:**
   - Once you have finalized the schema, press "OK" to complete the setup.
   - The system will provide a link to download your website with the specified customizations.
   - Download the folder and open it.

6. **Running the Website:**
   - Open the command line in the downloaded folder.
   - Run the command `python manage.py runserver`.
   - Follow the link provided in the command line to access your website.
   - Append "/admin" to the URL to access the admin interface, where you can manage your database entries (insert, read, delete, update) as the website owner.
